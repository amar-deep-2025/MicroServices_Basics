# MicroServices_Basics
This repository is for the basics of microservices what is, how and why .

# Monolithic Architecture ?
A monolithic  architecture is a software design pattern, where all components of a system as integrated into a single, unified application.

## Challenges
* Tight Coupling
* Maintenance Complexity
* Deployment Risks
* Scalability Issues

# Microservices Architecture ?
* Microservice is not technology/language.
* It is not a framework.
* It is not aa API.
* It is an architectural design pattern.
* It is universal and anyone can use this architecture to develop applications.

* Micro services architecture is a design pattern where an application is composed of multiple small, independently deployable services that communicate over a network. 

# Advantages With Microservices
* Loose Coupling
* Burden Reduced on  server.
* Easy maintenance
* Quickly deliveries
* Scalability
* Technology diversity
* No single point of failure.

#  Challenges with Microservices ?
1) Bounded Context 
2) Repeated configurations 
3) Visibility 

## Bounded Context 
Bounded context means identifying how many microservices we need to develop for one application and deciding which functionality we need to ass in which microservices.

In several microservice architecture we might not get chance to work with all apis in the application.

================================
Microservices Architecture
================================
There is no fixed architecture for microservices development. 

We can customize microservices architecture according to our project.

As part of Microservices architecture we are going to use below components (all the below component are not mandatory).

1) Service Registry (Eureka)
2) Admin Server
3) Zipkin Server
4) Config Server
5) Kafka Server
6) Redis Server
7) FeignClient
8) API Gateway
